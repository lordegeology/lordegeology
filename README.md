# Hey, I'm Ankit!

🎯 **Data Scientist | Quant Enthusiast | AI/ML Engineer**  

---

## 🚀 What I Do  
- 💼 By day: **AI/ML Analyst at Deloitte USI** — currently building **agentic workflows** with GenAI, LangGraph, and AWS to make insurance claims *actually bearable*.  
- 📈 Previously: did **quant research at Futures First** (built ARIMAX & LSTM models to predict markets), interned at **Genpact** (optimized ML pipelines for a media giant), and dabbled in **COVID spike protein analysis at IIIT-Delhi**.  
- 📝 Published a paper at **IMECE2023** on 3D printing & fracture energy ([read it here](https://doi.org/10.1115/IMECE2023-112241)) — yes, I’ve actually broken plastics *academically*.

## ⚡ Outside of Work  
- 🥊 I box every so often (great for stress relief [more of an excuse to punch stuff :p]).  
- 🎹 I play the piano & ukulele — though depending on the day it’s either a vibe or a war crime.

## 🛠️ Current Obsessions  
- **Agentic AI** → LangGraph, RAG pipelines, multimodal Gen AI.  
- **Finance x AI** → still geeking out about time series models & quant strategies.  
- **Automation** → making dashboards, pipelines, and workflows so I don’t have to do things twice.
