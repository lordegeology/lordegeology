# Hey, I'm Ankit!

**Data Scientist | Quant Enthusiast | AI/ML Engineer**  

---

## 🚀 What I Do  
- 💼 By day: **AI/ML Analyst at Deloitte USI** — currently building **agentic workflows** with LangGraph and AWS - *super glamorous stuff!*  
- 📈 Previously: did **quant research at Futures First** (built ARIMAX & LSTM models to predict markets), interned at **Genpact** (optimized ML pipelines for a media giant), and dabbled in **COVID spike protein analysis using NLP at IIIT-Delhi**.  
- 📝 Published a paper at **IMECE2023** on 3D printing & fracture energy ([check it out!!](https://doi.org/10.1115/IMECE2023-112241)) — *got to play around with 3d printers; it was pretty cool!*

## ⚡ Outside of Work  
- 🥊 I box every so often (great for stress relief {*more of an excuse to punch stuff :p*}).  
- 🎹 I play the piano & ukulele — though depending on the day it’s either a vibe or a war crime.

## 🛠️ Learning/Working On:  
- **Agentic AI** → LangGraph, RAG pipelines, multimodal Gen AI.  
- **Finance x AI** → interested in quant strategies and developments in the use of AI in the fintech space.  
- **Automation** → making dashboards, pipelines, and workflows so I don’t have to do things twice.
